## Image Sources

You can use your app store screenshots for the landing page. If you've already prepared screenshots for App Store submission, you can use those same images here.

For the hero image (`hero-device.png`), you can create a device mockup using:
- [Mockuphone](https://mockuphone.com/)
- [Mockup Generator](https://mockupgenerator.app/)
- [Device Shots](https://deviceshots.com/)

## Image Optimization

Before uploading images to GitHub, optimize them for web:
- Use JPG format for screenshots (good quality, 80-90%)
- Use PNG for images requiring transparency
- Keep file sizes under 500KB when possible for faster page loading

## Placeholder Images (Temporary)

If you need placeholder images during development, you can use:
- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
- Example: `https://via.placeholder.com/375x812.png?text=Wallpath+Screenshot`
